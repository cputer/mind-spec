# Types & Variables

MIND is a statically typed language with a focus on tensor operations and safety.

## Primitive Types
- **i32 / i64**: Signed integers.
- **f32 / f64**: IEEE 754 floating point numbers.
- **bool**: Boolean (`true` / `false`).

## Tensor Type
Tensors are the core primitive, defined by a data type and a shape.
```mind
let image: tensor<f32[3, 224, 224]>;
```

## Fixed-size arrays

`[T; n]` declares an array with exactly `n` elements of type `T`:

```mind
let samples: [i64; 4] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
```

An explicit `let` or `const` annotation requires a literal with the same
element count, including inside functions, branches, and loops. A three- or
five-element literal cannot initialize `[i64; 4]`. Parenthesized and nested
literals follow the same rule. See the
[normative cardinality rule](spec/v1.0/types.md#fixed-array-literal-cardinality).

## Structs
User-defined compound types.
```rust
struct Model {
    layers: i32,
    learning_rate: f32,
}
```
